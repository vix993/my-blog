## Status

Still implementing CI

<!-- ![example workflow](https://github.com/vix993/letmeask/actions/workflows/test_on_push.yml/badge.svg) -->

## Motivation

This repository holds my portfolio, blog and personal website.

[`https://vic-nasc.vercel.app/`](https://vic-nasc.vercel.app/).

In this project, I created a simple next.js app to promote my work and studies.

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `cd my-blog`,`yarn install` then executing the command `yarn dev`.

You will be able to access the server on localhost:3000 by default.

## Requirements

Typescript, Tailwind Css, Material UI and more.
